# Predicting-the-rating-of-Amazon-reviews
This project contains a file named "Python_CBP" in which we train the dataset which are taken from [Amazon AWS](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html). A dataset of 20000 rows is considered here. The reviews in the dataset are first cleaned and all the stop words are removed. The training and testing dataset are split in a ratio of 5:1. The dataset is trained using Random Forest Classifier and the accuracy of the test set is 76.5%. Further, individual reviews can be evaluated in a GUI(Jupyter Notebook) or from the input in Google Colab.
